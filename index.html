      <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
      <p>
        This website serves as a collection of information about me, designed as
        part of an assignment but also as a proactive step toward preparing for
        my career. Crafting an organized and compelling resume is essential for
        securing internships and landing a job after college. Through this
        website, I’m able to present everything I’d need to showcase in a job
        interview, giving potential employers a clear picture of my skills,
        experiences, and qualifications.
